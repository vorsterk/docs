| **Anonymisation** | A process by which personal data is irreversibly altered in such a way that a data subject can no longer be identified directly or indirectly, either by the data controller alone or in collaboration with any other party (ISO/TS 25237:2017). |     |     |     |
| **Data collection (or collection)** | The GDPR uses the term "collect" to refer to the practice of getting personal data directly from a data subject. |     |     |     |

| **Name** | **Definition** | **Guidelines** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Personal data** | Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (data subject); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location  <br>data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person (GDPR, art. 4(1)). |     | - Name and surname<br>    <br>- Home address<br>    <br>- Email address<br>    <br>- Identification card number<br>    <br>- Location data<br>    <br>- IP addresses |
| **Profiling** | any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural personâ€™s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements. |     |     |
| **Pseudonym**<br><br>**(or cryptonym or nym)** | A piece of information associated to an identifier of an individual or any other kind of personal data (e.g. location data). Pseudonyms  <br>may have different degrees of linkability (to the original identifiers). The degree of linkability of different pseudonym types is important to consider for evaluating the strength of pseudonyms  <br>but also for the design of pseudonymous systems where a certain degree of linkability may be desired (e.g. when analysing pseudonymous log files or for reputation systems). |     |     |
| **Pseudonymisation** | The processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and  <br>organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person (GDPR, art. 4(5)). |     |     |
