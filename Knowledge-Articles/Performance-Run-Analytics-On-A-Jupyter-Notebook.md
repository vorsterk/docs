# Performance Run Analytics on a Jupyter Notebook

## Motivation:

Currently, our processors have a `prcgTm` field which is attached to each message that that particular processor receives. This field represents the time that was recorded by the processor handling that particular message. Thatâ€™s one of the tools we can use to have an overall idea of where we are spending a lot of time in the platform.  

Naturally, we may want to compare how the different times stack up against each other.

## Workflow:

Do a performance run (`n` number of transactions are sent through the platform).

1. Get the respective times for each processor in the run and display how they compare:

    - For all transactions, total up the processors' `prcgTm`

2. Generate a frequency distribution diagram for the current run showing how many transactions performed better than the average value (of that run)

3. Show different percentile values for each different processor:

4. Show percentiles for the different rules

    - So we can easily pinpoint which rule is the slowest

5. Write the dataset to persistent storage, recording the `min`, `max` and `average` for each processor in the run so it can be used for comparison against future runs.

6. Select the last best `n` runs in terms of transaction average in the run (`run duration` / `number of transactions in the run`)

    1. Then compare the different processors `min` `max` and `average` values
