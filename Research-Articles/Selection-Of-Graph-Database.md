## ‚ùìProblem statement

* * *

Many rules in the action ecosystem will need to be solved in graphs. Therefore, we need to pick a database for the platform.

## üí°Research insights

* * *

JanusGraph proved to be a difficult database to work with. On 16/02/02, research on how ArangoDB was made to replace JanusGraph.

## üìä Solution hypothesis

* * *

ArangoDB provides a better solution for Tazama

## üåà Design options

## ArangoDB setup

ArangoDB can run on different deployments.

You can run a docker file:

`docker run -p 8529:8529 -e ARANGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=123456 arangodb/arangodb:3.7.9`

Or you can proceed to a full local installation (Recommended)

Ubuntu Link: [https://www.arangodb.com/download-major/ubuntu/](https://www.arangodb.com/download-major/ubuntu/)

Other installations resources: [https://www.arangodb.com/download-major/](https://www.arangodb.com/download-major/)

During the creation of this guide, we‚Äôll be using the local version since it allows us to easily use **arangosh**, which is a shell for ArangoDB.

Whichever deployment option you choose, you should be able to access the ArangoDB portal in your localhost: [http://localhost:8529](http://localhost:8529). The portal will ask you for credentials, so use the password you choose for the docker container while running it, or the password you choose while installing manually. Once you‚Äôre here, let‚Äôs try to create a new user:

If you have a local instance, you should be able to access the shell by typing `arangosh` from you terminal. then type your password and you‚Äôre in!

If you‚Äôre using a docker container, you should be able to exec into it with something similar to this:

`docker exec -it containerId - arangosh`

Let‚Äôs create a user now:

`const users = require('@arangodb/users');`

choose your name and password:

`users.save('aaronreynoza', 'password');`

and while at it, let‚Äôs create a database:

`db._createDatabase('testdb')`

and grant access to our new user:

`users.grantDatabase('aaronreynoza', 'testdb', 'rw');`

If you notice, the syntax is pretty similar to JavaScript. That‚Äôs everything we‚Äôll do in arangosh so far. Let‚Äôs move to the portal again. Login to your new database with your new user.

So far, there‚Äôs two examples:

- the PoC historical Data Set
- FCA 1 million transactions Set

Let‚Äôs go ahead and run our first program.

### Running the co-located parties engine with PoC Data

This small project was created using the PoC data that was inserted in Redis. However, the data needed to be modified into two JSON files: An ILP collection and a transfers Edge. Edges are events that happen between collections.

The tool used to convert this data can be found [here](https://github.com/mojaloop/fraud_risk_management/tree/arango-example/arango-example).

If yo don‚Äôt want to convert the data yourself, you can use the `demo-docs.json` and `demo-transfers.json` files added in the branch. Lets go to our arangodb web portal. Now to collections ‚Üí Add Collection ‚Üí Name the new collection ‚Äúdocs‚Äù ‚Üí Save it.

Now click in the database and click in the small upload icon on the top right.

![](../images/Screenshot_from_2021-03-09_00-47-46.png)

Notice that we can now attach a file. Add the `demo-docs.json` file and click on ‚ÄúImport JSON‚Äù.

You should now have 34 new docs. Nice!

Get back to collections, now add a new collection named ‚Äútransactions‚Äù BUT change the type to ‚ÄúEDGE‚Äù. **THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.** Now follow the same process as before adding the `demo-transactions.json` file.

we can create our graph now.

On the side menu, go to ‚ÄúGRAPHS‚Äù and add a new one. call it ‚Äútransactions‚Äù. for ‚ÄúEdge definitions‚Äù, choose ‚Äútransactions‚Äù, Choose ‚Äúdocs‚Äù for both ‚ÄúfromCollections‚Äù and ‚ÄútoCollections‚Äù. Click on Create.

You now have your graph ready!

You can test queries by going to the ‚Äúqueries‚Äù part on the side menu. let‚Äôs try a subset of the co-located parties query:

```sql
FOR v, e, p IN 2..2 OUTBOUND
    "docs/g.tz.fsp001.msisdn.2558617728568"
    GRAPH "transactions"
    FILTER e.\_to == "docs/g.tz.fsp001.msisdn.2558617728568"
    return p
```

Let‚Äôs try to understand the query:

We map thru our graph using a For loop. the graph we‚Äôre mapping is defined in line 3. the For is de-structured like this:

v = vertices (docs)

e = edges (transactions)

p = path (vertices + transactions)

IN 2..2 = level of graph granularity to operate. We need to change it to 3..3 for the actual rule.

OUTBOUND = direction you want to traverse

"docs/g.tz.fsp001.msisdn.2558617728568" = doc to traverse. this is our ‚Äúpayer‚Äù

FILTER e._to == "docs/g.tz.fsp001.msisdn.2558617728568" = find ILPS in layer 3 that send transfers to the original payer.

return p = returns the entire vertices and edges for the condition.

if you run that command, you‚Äôll notice that there‚Äôs no output. that‚Äôs because there‚Äôs no transfers from the second graph tier to the first payer! lets add that transactions. Go to collections, then transactions, and click on the green ‚Äú+‚Äù button. In ‚Äú_from‚Äù type `docs/g.tz.fsp001.msisdn.2558617728569` and in ‚Äú_to‚Äù type `docs/g.tz.fsp001.msisdn.2558617728568`. click on save and now try to run the query again. Now we have the condition for the rule to succeed! This is the result:

![](../images/Screenshot_from_2021-03-09_01-01-41.png)

Notice that the level of granularity only goes up to 2 levels. This is because we don‚Äôt have the data setup for this scenario. More on that in the github `README.md`

Let‚Äôs run it in the rule engine now.

download the branch mentioned above and inside the `arangodb-example` folder, run `npm install`. now clone the `template.env` and create your own `env file` with your config.

run `npm start` to run the same query shown above. you can change the ILP by passing it as a variable `npm start yourIlpHere`.

### Running the co-located parties engine with FCA Data

FCA data doesn‚Äôt have data (currently know) that matches this rule. You can run the exact same instructions mentioned above.

The files can be found [here](https://lextego-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/p/aaron_reynoza/Etv-lkmB5CdJtQbHyEsHFOYBqQQnKRfysFSjgqc8uIFl1A?e=3yfFwO).

The process should be the same. Just create the collection with the name `ILPS` for the edge collection, name it `transfers`.

remember to change the graph name inside the query in the file `graph-query.js`. On line 19.

### Gremlin for ArangoDB

ArangoDB can run with Grenlim. In order to try this, let‚Äôs first download the gremlin console [from here](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/tinkerpop/3.4.10/apache-tinkerpop-gremlin-console-3.4.10-bin.zip).

Now let‚Äôs decompress the file, open the folder and move to the `/conf` folder. now create a file named `arango.properties` and add the config with your database configuration. Example:

```conf
gremlin.arangodb.conf.graph.name = demo-transactions
gremlin.arangodb.conf.graph.db = Getting-Started
gremlin.arangodb.conf.arangodb.user = root
gremlin.arangodb.conf.arangodb.password = 123456
```

Now let‚Äôs start the gremlin console:

`bin/gremlin.sh`

and install the arangodb provider:

`:install org.arangodb arangodb-tinkerpop-provider 2.0.2`

after the action is completed, you should be able to list the extension with:

`:plugin list`

now activate the plugin:

`:plugin use tinkerpop.arangodb`

and connect to our database:

`import org.apache.commons.configuration.PropertiesConfiguration`

change this to your own path:

`config = new org.apache.commons.configuration.PropertiesConfiguration("/some/path/arango.properties")`

then connect the graph:

`g = ArangoDBGraph.open(config)`

This should work, however, this is the current output that we get:

```
gremlin> g = ArangoDBGraph.open(config)
WARN  com.arangodb.tinkerpop.gremlin.structure.ArangoDBGraph  - Empty edges collection(s), the default 'edge' collection will be used.
Not all declared vertex names appear in the graph. Missing \[demo-transactions\_vertex\]
Type ':help' or ':h' for help.
Display stack trace? \[yN\]y
com.arangodb.tinkerpop.gremlin.client.ArangoDBGraphException: Not all declared vertex names appear in the graph. Missing \[demo-transactions\_vertex\]

```

Further investigation needs to be done.
