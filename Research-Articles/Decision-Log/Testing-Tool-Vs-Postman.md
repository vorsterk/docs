## what can we do with this information

we currently have a testing tool that works and can do the basis of all our testing we need

but it will need a lot of modification to be able to do testing that is coming up as it was mainly build to test GRPC

that will take a lot of work to do as to where we can shift over to using postman collections to do all of the testings we need

as a QA I am suggesting we use postman to do our tests and if we canâ€™t test a scenario using postman we can do it using the testing tool eg. with GRPC or if we need a test to do something that postman just cant do
