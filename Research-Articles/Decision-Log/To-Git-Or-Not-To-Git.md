## Background

As we start to create code - we require a clear workflow tool to give us better control of the code release approvals.

We have GitBucket included in our OpenSource project

Mojaloop is invested in GitHub

Our current GitHub repo is a basic service - and we need to investigate if the more advanced controls are also free.

Moving to another tool will require validation with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

## Requirements

- Big files support (Git LFS)
- Do we need to set custom security rules? if yes, self-hosted would be better(?)
- Pricing
- Ease of use
- Typologies, Rules will be in the private repo

## Options considered

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Description | **Bitbucket** gives teams one place to plan projects, collaborate on code, test and deploy, all with free private Git repositories. Teams choose Bitbucket because it has a superior Jira integration, built-in CI/CD, & is free for up to 5 users. | **GitHub**Â is a web-based GitÂ or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It was originally launched in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyatt. This is the largest repository host with more than 38+ million projects. | GitHub-hosted runners offer a quicker, simpler way to run your workflows, while self-hosted runners are a highly configurable way to run workflows in your own custom environment. | **GitLab's SaaS** offering. You don't need to install anything to use GitLab SaaS, you only need toÂ [sign up](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in)Â and use GitLab straight away. | Install, administer, and maintain your own GitLab instance. |

## Build minutes and Git Large File Storage

**GitHub Git LFS**

Every account using Git Large File Storage receives 1 GB of free storage and 1 GB a month of free bandwidth.

Additional storage and bandwidth is offered in a single data pack. One data pack costs $5 per month, and provides a monthly quota of 50 GB for bandwidth and 50 GB for storage. You can purchase as many data packs as you need. For example, if you need 150 GB of storage, you'd buy three data packs.

Purchasing data packs for Git LFS is independent of any other paid feature or product on GitHub.

**Bitbucket Git LFS Defaults ðŸ‘‡**

**Standard**

Build minutes: 2,500 min/month

Large file storage: 5 GB total

**Premium**

Build minutes: 3,500 min/month

Large file storage: 10 GB

## Conclusion

There are two main criteria affecting the result. (**Pricing** and **Feature-Support**)

For pricing, *Bitbucket* has a huge advantage for scale. After 20 paid accounts the price gap between *GitHub* and *Bitbucket* is **drastically increasing**.

For feature-side, these two options (GitHub and Bitbucket) have support for most of the used features.

- Git LFS
- Security
- Roles
- CI/CD

**GitHub** is preferred by organizations which is working on open source projects but considering the pricing and other business integrations (Jira, Confluence etc) **Bitbucket** shine out.

Assume that have 20 accounts and needs 200Â GB big file storage.

- GitHub Team

(Accounts **\*** *per person) **+** ($5 **\**** per package) = Price

(20 **\*** 4) + (5 * 4) = **$100**

- Bitbucket Standard

(Accounts **\*** *per person) **+** ($10 **\**** per 100 GB) = Price

$15 (flat rate up to 5 users) + $45 (20 * 3) + $20 (10 * 2) = **$80**

* * *

## Action items

- Review all options
- Offer another suggestion if you have
- Agree on an approach (in the meeting)

## Outcome

Considering the all comparison (pricing and features) Bitbucket Standard shines out.
