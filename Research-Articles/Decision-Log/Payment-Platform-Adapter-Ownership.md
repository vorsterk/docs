# Payment Platform Adapter ownership

Technical ownership

Operational Ownership

(Who operates it; in whose security fold does it sit)

Client hosting

Pros

Simpler Tazama management

Abstraction of the variety/diversity away from Tazama

Transfer of hosting costs to client

Tazama only talks to ONE end-point per customer

Simpler interface specification for Tazama (only ISO)

PPA is seamless to Tazama

No concern for security arrangements on the client-side

Models on Mojaloop architectural principle

Cons

Client knowledge/skill

Additional operating cost to the client

Regulatory/Compliance overheads for the client

Ongoing maintenance and support is assumed to be the responsibility of the client after implementation

- PPA must be adapted to Mojaloopâ€™s security protocols
