## Background

Basically, CI is the practice of regularly merging all working copies of a code to a shared mainline, multiple times a day. The CI collects all the code changes in one place, prepares their publication, and tests and prepares the code release. All this helps minimize human error in code review (which grows as the team grows), saves time, and improves the quality of the code.
