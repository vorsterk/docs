# What's with all the data

Add your comments directly to the page. Include links to any relevant research, data, or feedback.

Currently we are creating Synthetic data following the work with the FCA. To date there is 3GB of data and we wish to make that data public (even if we are not making the tools to create that data public).

Initial investigations considered the use of Git [LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)

This page explores all the options and provides a recommendation.

Alternative options can be found here for example:
