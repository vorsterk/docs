# Technical​ ​Charter (the “Charter”) for <br> Tazama Project
Adopted November 29, 2023

This Charter sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the Tazama open source project (the “Project”), which has been established as a project of LF Charities, Inc. , a Delaware nonprofit corporation and Section 509(a)(3) supporting organization that is tax exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of the United States (“LF Charities”).  All contributors (including committers, maintainers, and other technical positions) and other participants in the Project (collectively, “Collaborators”) must comply with the terms of this Charter. 

## 1. Mission and Scope of the Project 
<ol type="a">
<li> The mission of the Project is to develop and maintain an open source fraud detection mechanism for instant payment systems, in order to improve the safety of using those systems, particularly for the poorest and most vulnerable customers that those systems serve.
</li>
<li> The scope of the Project includes collaborative development under the Project License (as defined herein) supporting the mission, including documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the open source project.</li></ol>

## 2. Technical Steering Committee 
<ol type="a">
<li> The Technical Steering Committee (the “TSC”) will be responsible for all technical oversight of the open source Project. </li>
<li> The TSC voting members are initially the Project’s Committers that are designated as voting TSC members. At the inception of the project, the Committers of the Project will be as set forth within the “CONTRIBUTING” file within the Project’s code repository. The TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the TSC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in the CONTRIBUTING file.  Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person. </li>
<li> TSC projects generally will involve Contributors and Committers. The TSC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in the CONTRIBUTING file. Unless otherwise documented: 
 
<ol type="i">
<li> Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the Project; </li>
<li> Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify (“commit”) source code, documentation or other technical artifacts in a project’s repository; and </li>
<li> A Contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval of the existing Committers. A Committer may be removed by a majority approval of the other existing Committers. </li></ol>
<li> Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and Committer is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of this Charter.  </li>
<li> The TSC may (1) establish work flow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit.</li>
<li> The TSC may elect a TSC Chair, who will preside over meetings of the TSC and will serve until their resignation or replacement by the TSC.   </li>
<li> Responsibilities: The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Project, which may include: </li>
<ol type="i">
<li> coordinating the technical direction of the Project and maintaining a list of technical requirements for features, functionality and performance of any release of code of the Project (collectively, the “Technical Requirements”); </li>
<li> approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project’s scope); </li>
<li> organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects; </li>
<li> creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements; </li>
<li> appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities; </li>
<li> establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies; </li>
<li> approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing (to be published in the CONTRIBUTING file) and coordinating with LF Charities to resolve matters or concerns that may arise as set forth in Section 7 of this Charter; </li>
<li> discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple projects; and </li>
<li> coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the Project. </li>
</ol>
</ol>

## 3. End User Committee
<ol type="a"> 
<li> “End User Organization” means any national bank, government financial agency, regulator, or law enforcement agency of any country, with particular attention to include those specifically designated by the United Nations as a “Least Developed Country”. Banks, fintechs, other financial organizations, or other nonprofit organizations in a regulatory other specialty related to financial crime also qualify asEnd User Organizations. </li>
<li> The End User Committee (“EUC”) is composed of one individual appointed by each End User Organization and at the inception of the Project the initial members of the EUC will be those organizations listed on Project’s web site.  Any End User Organization may appoint a different representative to the EUC upon notice to the Project. </li>
<li> The EUC will aim to meet quarterly unless a different meeting cadence is chosen by the EUC.  The purpose of the EUC is to provide the project with feedback on use cases and features and other requirements of end users of the Technical Project.  If at any point the TSC feels that the EUC has grown to a size where it would be advisable for purposes of efficiency to adopt an alternative structure (such as having representation from industry associations of End User Organizations versus particular End User Organizations appoint representatives to the EUC), the TSC can change the provisions of this Section 3 by simple vote.</li>
</ol>

## 4. Charitable Committee
<ol type="a"> 
<li> The Charitable Committee is composed of representatives of charitable organizations, nonprofits, government agencies and/or private foundations who support through their work the Charitable Purposes as identified by LF Charities.
